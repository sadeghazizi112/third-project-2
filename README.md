# _Third Independent Project - Second Attempt_

#### _The third independent project of Epidocus, this one using Arrays and Looping, {5/21/2020}_

#### By _**Sadegh Azizi**_

## Description

_This is a program designed to convert numbers into a range of numbers, ranging from 0, to the inputted number itself. Then it will loop through. If the number in the range contains a zero, the output is "beep!", if the number contains a 1, the out is "boop!" if the number when divided by 3 has a remainder of 0, then the output is "I'm sorry, Dave." The program will prioritize the largest number to judge which condition to enact._
